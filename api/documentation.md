> Your documentation should be functional. You should create examples that users can work with, embed, and even test within sandbox environments

> One suggestion he made is to leverage personalization to make documentation pages more user friendly. "Documentation should be more than a static page. Treat it like a web app where documentation can adapt to the user."  

> Having a status page that lets people check if your API has any other widespread problems or if it is just how they are using it.  

> Examples of how to make calls should be complete within a documentation page, offering some sort of mock testing capability (i.e., a sandbox where the API actually responds with non-production or "mock" data) as well as a temporary API key from within the documentation that allows developers to sample the API without having to obtain his or her own key.
