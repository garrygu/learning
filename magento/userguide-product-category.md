- Every product must be assigned to at least one category.
- The first level of categories below the root typically appear as options in the main menu. Below that, you can have as many additional subcategories as you need.

## Root Category
- The root category is basically a container for the main menu.
- The root has a name, but no URL key, and does not appear in the top navigation of the store.
- All other categories in the menu are nested below the root.
- Your store can have only one root category active at a time.

## Hidden Categories
There are many ways to use hidden categories. You might want to create additional category levels for your own internal purposes, but show only the higher-level categories to your customers. Or, you might want to link to a category that is not included in the navigation menu.  
- Set `Is Active` to “Yes.”
- Set `Include in Menu` to “No.”
- In the `Display Settings` section, set Anchor to “No.”
