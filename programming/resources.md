# polyfill
> A polyfill is typically JavaScript code that supports a new function if the Web browser has not yet been updated to the latest version. For example, HTML5 added many new features. If Web designers wanted their websites to take advantage of some of those features, they might have supplied polyfill code to perform the function if the users' browser could not.
