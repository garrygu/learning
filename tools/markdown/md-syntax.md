Headers
======
Markdown supports two styles of headers, Setext and atx:

Setext-style headers
------
Setext-style headers are “underlined” using equal signs (for first-level headers) and dashes (for second-level headers). For example:
```
This is an H1
=============

This is an H2
-------------
```

Atx-style headers
------
Atx-style headers use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line, corresponding to header levels 1-6. For example:
```
# This is an H1

## This is an H2

###### This is an H6
```
